# Todo

The following topics are on the wishlist
- Usage report for product usage
- Caching of coveragerequest as the rate limit is very strict (hosts-certificate)
- Add review summary for every report, not just a csv
- Feedback while the app runs
- Support for other output types
- Use golang features currently underutilized, concurrency (performance), interfaces (dependancies), better error handling,  

# Done
- Usage reports with reporting groups
- Aliases for products, contracts 
- Aliases for commands
